    "The KOM CPC traces its roots to the late 1980’s, when the area surrounding Oakridge Centre experienced increased criminal activity.",
    "The closure of the neighbourhood’s policing sub-station removed a visible police presence, further concerning residents. ",
    "Citizens eventually created a focus group at the Oakridge Senior’s Centre, with the goal of improving area safety and crime awareness.",
    "At the same time, the Marpole Oakridge Area Council Society (MOACS) sought a location for its members to access crime prevention information.",
    "Sensing an opportunity for collaboration, the Vancouver Police Department advised both organizations to work together, and assigned a full-time constable to the area.",
    "Office space on 5655 Cambie Street was donated by Dr. Chun Gunn, and furnishings were donated by volunteers and the VPD.",
    "On July 5th, 1999, the Marpole Oakridge Community Policing Centre opened its doors and became a part of Vancouver’s community policing system.",
    "It’s initial jurisdictions of Marpole and Oakridge would soon expand, adding Kerrisdale and Dunbar in 2001, becoming the KOM CPC.",
    "The office’s location would move shortly afterward, for a geographically central location."
