Utilizing current and historic crime data, as well as inputs from residents, patrols are dispatched into neighbourhoods to be ‘eyes and ears’ for the community, and a deterrent. Patrols also provide awareness to residents in the event of heightened criminal activity, and are happy to answer any questions.",
